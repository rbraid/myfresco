#I am assuming that the Beam-like is left in the ground state.  We see the excitation is most often carried in the target-like from the data.  In principle it would be nice to use FRESCO to calculate the cross sections for both possibilities.  This is actually an interesting problem, since transferring the 2s1/2 gives beam-like in ground state and target-like excited.  However, transferring the 1p3/2 gives the opposite configuration!

# incoming scattering 11Be+9Be (kp=1) (This is taken from our fits on elastic scattering)  This is questionable right now, external input needed.  Only the type 1 is fit all other values taken from references.  In particular, the deformations (type=10) are taken from Keri's input file. They are poorly understood by me.  Doubly so for the fact that they imply a coupling.
